ðŸ“Š How to read it (in simple terms):

Each row is one factor that the system looks at.

Each dot is one person (or moment).

The left/right position shows whether that factor made the system more or less likely to trigger an alert:

Dots on the right mean that feature pushed the system toward triggering an alert.

Dots on the left mean it pushed the system away from an alert.

The color shows the value of the factor:

Red means high, like high heart rate or older age.

Blue means low, like low heart rate or younger age.

ðŸ§  What does the plot tell us?

The system mostly bases alerts on behavioral signs like if someoneâ€™s eyes are closed, theyâ€™re not looking straight, or their heart rate is high.

Things like age, gender, and race donâ€™t seem to affect the decision much, which is good because it suggests the system isnâ€™t making biased decisions based on who someone is.

âœ… In short:
This plot helps us understand what the system is "thinking" when it decides to trigger an alert â€” and it shows that alerts are mainly driven by behavior, not by personal traits like gender or race.
